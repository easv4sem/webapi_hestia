ðŸ”¥ HESTIA : Wildfire Monitoring Backend â€“ Project Overview

This backend powers an IoT-based real-time wildfire monitoring system designed to reduce response time and damage from natural fires in Denmark. With droughts and wildfire risks increasing due to climate change, this solution uses a network of smart sensors to detect early signs of fire.

The system collects and processes data from multiple sources:

    Temperature sensors

    Soil moisture sensors

    Smoke detectors

    Visual cameras

Using this data, the system identifies high-risk areas and triggers early warnings to emergency services. Additionally, it stores environmental data for long-term analysis and research in climate, nature conditions, and fire behavior.
